 Download the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets from the exoplanet catalog http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/. Look for the column titled e, which denotes eccentricity. Draw the histogram of this distribution. Then redraw the same histogram after Gaussianization of  the distribution using Box-transformation either using scipy.stats.boxcox or from first principles using the equations  in arXiv:1508.00931. Note that exoplanets without eccentricity data can be ignored.
After Box-cox transformation you should get a plot similar to the right side of figure 1 in arXiv:1508.00931.
